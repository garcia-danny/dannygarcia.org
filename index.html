      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Danny Garcia â€” a 19-year-old self-taught web developer living on the West Coast.
         I build websites but generally have my heart set on the whole field of tech. In a typical 
         day, I will delve into anything which catches my attention: new domains, new tools, or 
         new concepts-sterling curiosity and thirst for knowledge propelling it all. 
        </p>

<p>
For the most part, my development career was pursued by my own initiative, meaning I learned 
mostly from online materials, experimenting, and developing. I am most comfortable where I can 
apply my own skills, contribute, and collaborate to keep myself learning as I go along. 
</p>

<p> Outside tech, personal development and well-being rank highly for me. I am fit and relatively 
  health-conscious; in fact, I am always striving to improve myself mentally and physically.</p>
