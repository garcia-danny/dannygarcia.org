      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a computer and cybersecurity enthusiast based in California with a passion for coding,
        both as a profession and a hobby. Beyond tech, I enjoy capturing moments on my Polaroid
        and spending quality time with friends. I thrive on learning, problem-solving, 
        and exploring the intersection of technology and creativity. I recently started getting
        into hiking and love to see the mountians. 
        </p>
<p>
        I grew up in California, and it's the only place I've ever called home.
         After graduating high school, I enrolled in community college to further
          my education and work toward an associate degree in computer science. One day,
          I hope to secure a tech job with google or a big tech company.
